# Introduction {#sec:intro}

This document illustrates some existing R infrastructure for the
analysis of proteomics data.  It presents the code for the use cases
taken from [@R4Prot2013,Gatto:2015]. A pre-print of [@R4Prot2013]
available on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6559) and [@Gatto:2015]
is [open access](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pmic.201400392/full).

There are however numerous additional R resources distributed by
the [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org)
and [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) repositories, as
well as packages hosted on personal websites. Section
\@ref(sec:packages) tries to provide a wider picture of available
packages, without going into details.

## General R resources {#sec:rres}

The reader is expected to have basic R knowledge to find the document
helpful. There are numerous R introductions freely available, some of
which are listed below.

From the R project web-page:

* *An Introduction to R* is based on the former *Notes on R*, gives an
  introduction to the language and how to use R for doing statistical
  analysis and graphics
  ([html](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html) and
  [pdf](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf).
* Several introductory tutorials in the
  [contributed documentation](http://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html) section.
* The [TeachingMaterial repository](https://github.com/lgatto/TeachingMaterial)
  contains several sets of slides and vignettes about R programming.


Relevant background on the R software and its application to
computational biology in general and proteomics in particular can also
be found in [@R4Prot2013]. For details about the Bioconductor
project, the reader is referred to [@Gentleman2004].

## Bioconductor resources {#sec:biocres}


The Bioconductor offers many educational resources on
its [help page](http://bioconductor.org/help/), in addition the
package's vignettes (vignettes are a requirement for Bioconductor
packages). We want to draw the attention to the Bioconductor work
flows that offer a cross-package overview about a specific topic. In
particular, there is now
a
[*Mass spectrometry and proteomics data analysis*](http://bioconductor.org/help/workflows/proteomics/) work
flow.

## Getting help

All R packages come with ample documentation. Every command
(function, class or method) a user is susceptible to use is
documented. The documentation can be accessed by preceding the command
by a `?` in the R console. For example, to obtain help about
the `library` function, that will be used in the next
section, one would type `?library`. In addition, all
Bioconductor packages come with at least one vignette (this document
is the vignette that comes with the `r Biocpkg("RforProteomics")`
package), a document that combines text and R code that is executed
before the pdf is assembled. To look up all vignettes that come with a
package, say `r Biocpkg("RforProteomics")` and then open the vignette of
interest, one uses the `vignette` function as illustrated
below. More details can be found in `?vignette`.

```{r vignette1, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## list all the vignettes in the RforProteomics package
vignette(package = "RforProteomics")
## Open the vignette called RforProteomics
vignette("RforProteomics", package = "RforProteomics")
## or just
vignette("RforProteomics")
```


R has several [mailing lists](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html). The
most relevant here being the main `R-help` list, *for discussion about
problem and solutions using R*, ideal for general R content and is not
suitable for bioinformatics or proteomics questions. Bioconductor also
offers several resources dedicated to bioinformatics matters and
Bioconductor packages, in particular the
main [Bioconductor support forum](https://support.bioconductor.org/)
for Bioconductor-related queries.


It is advised to read and comply to
the [posting guides](http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)
(and [here](http://bioconductor.org/help/mailing-list/posting-guide/)
to maximise the chances to obtain good responses. It is important to
specify the software versions using the `sessionInfo()` functions (see
an example output at the end of this document. It the question
involves some code, make sure to isolate the relevant portion and
report it with your question, trying to make
your
[code/example reproducible](https://github.com/hadley/devtools/wiki/Reproducibility>).

## Installation

The package should be installed using as described below:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("RforProteomics")
```

To install all dependencies and reproduce the code in the vignette,
replace the last line in the code chunk above with:)

```{r installation2, eval = FALSE}
BiocManager::install("RforProteomics", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Finally, the package can be loaded with

```{r loadR4Prot, warning=FALSE}
library("RforProteomics")
```

See also the `r Biocpkg("RforProteomics")`
[web page](http://lgatto.github.io/RforProteomics/) for more
information on installation.

## External dependencies

Some packages used in the document depend on external libraries that
need to be installed prior to the R packages:


* `r Biocpkg("mzR")` depends on
  the [Common Data Format](http://cdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (CDF) to
  CDF-based raw mass-spectrometry data. On Linux, the `libcdf` library
  is required.  On Debian-based systems, for instance, one needs to
  install the `libnetcdf-dev` package.
* `r Biocpkg("IPPD")` (and others) depend on the `r CRANpkg("XML")`
  package which requires the `libxml2` infrastructure on Linux. On
  Debian-based systems, one needs to install `libxml2-dev`.
* `r Biocpkg("biomaRt")` performs on-line requests using
  the [`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/) infrastructure. On Debian-based
  systems, you one needs to install `libcurl-dev` or
  `libcurl4-openssl-dev`.
* `r Biocpkg("MSGFplus")` is based on the `MS-GF+` java program and
  thus requires [Java 1.7](https://java.com) in order to work.

## Obtaining the code

The code in this document describes all the examples presented in
[@R4Prot2013] and can be copy, pasted and executed. It is however more
convenient to have it in a separate text file for better interaction
with R to easily modify and explore it. This can be achieved with the
`Stangle` function. One needs the Sweave source of this document (a
document combining the narration and the R code) and the `Stangle`
then specifically extracts the code chunks and produces a clean R
source file. If the package is installed, the following code chunk
will direct you to the `RforProteomics.R` file containing all the
annotated source code contained in this document.

```{r stangle, eval=TRUE, tidy=FALSE, error=FALSE}
## gets the vignette source
rfile <- system.file("doc/RforProteomics.R",
                     package = "RforProteomics")
rfile
```

## Prepare the working environment

The packages that we will depend on to execute the examples will be
loaded in the respective sections. Here, we pre-load packages that
provide general functionality used throughout the document.

```{r env, message=FALSE}
library("RColorBrewer") ## Color palettes
library("ggplot2")  ## Convenient and nice plotting
library("reshape2") ## Flexibly reshape data
```

# Data standards and input/output

## The mzR package {#sec:mzr}

### Raw MS data

The `r Biocpkg("mzR")` package [@Chambers2012] provides a unified
interface to various mass spectrometry open formats.  This code chunk,
taken from the `openMSfile` documentation, illustrated how
to open a connection to an raw data file. The example `mzML`
data is taken from the `r Biocexptpkg("msdata")` data package.  The code
below would also be applicable to an `mzXML`, `mzData`
or `netCDF` file.

```{r mzr}
## load the required packages
library("mzR") ## the software package
library("msdata") ## the data package
## below, we extract the releavant example file
## from the local 'msdata' installation
filepath <- system.file("microtofq", package = "msdata")
file <- list.files(filepath, pattern="MM14.mzML",
                   full.names=TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
## creates a commection to the mzML file
mz <- openMSfile(file)
## demonstraction of data access
basename(fileName(mz))
runInfo(mz)
instrumentInfo(mz)
## once finished, it is good to explicitely
## close the connection
close(mz)
```

`r Biocpkg("mzR")` is used by other packages, like `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")`
[@Gatto2012], `r Biocpkg("TargetSearch")` [@TargetSearch2009] and
`r Biocpkg("xcms")` [@Smith2006, Benton2008, Tautenhahn2008], that
provide a higher level abstraction to the data.

### Identification data

The `r Biocpkg("mzR")` package also provides very fast access to
`mzIdentML` data by leveraging proteowizard's `C++`
parser.

```{r mzrid}
file <- system.file("mzid", "Tandem.mzid.gz", package="msdata")
mzid <- openIDfile(file)
mzid
```

Once and `mzRident` identification file handle has been
established, various data and metadata can be extracted, as
illustrated below.

```{r mzrid2}
softwareInfo(mzid)
enzymes(mzid)
names(psms(mzid))
head(psms(mzid))[, 1:13]
```

## Handling MS2 identification data with `r Biocpkg("mzID")` {#subsec:mzID}

The `r Biocpkg("mzID")` package allows to load and manipulate MS2 data
in the `mzIdentML` format. The main `mzID` function
reads such a file and constructs an instance of class `mzID`.

```{r mzid1}
library("mzID")
mzids <- list.files(system.file('extdata', package = 'mzID'),
                    pattern = '*.mzid', full.names = TRUE)
mzids
id <- mzID(mzids[1])
id
```

Multiple files can be parsed in one go, possibly in parallel if the
environment supports it. When this is done an mzIDCollection object
is returned:

```{r mzid2}
ids <- mzID(mzids[1:2])
ids
```

Peptides, scans, parameters, ... can be extracted with the
respective `peptides`, `scans`,
`parameters`, ... functions. The `mzID` object
can also be converted into a `data.frame` using the
`flatten` function.

```{r flatid}
fid <- flatten(id)
names(fid)
dim(fid)
```


# Raw data abstraction with `MSnExp` objects

`r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` [@Gatto2012] provides base functions and
classes for MS-based proteomics that allow facile data and meta-data
processing, manipulation and plotting (see for instance figure below).

```{r msnexp0}
library("MSnbase")
## uses a simple dummy test included in the package
mzXML <- dir(system.file(package="MSnbase",dir="extdata"),
             full.name=TRUE,
             pattern="mzXML$")
basename(mzXML)
## reads the raw data into and MSnExp instance
raw <- readMSData(mzXML, verbose = FALSE, centroided = TRUE)
raw
## Extract a single spectrum
raw[[3]]
```


```{r msnexp, fig.cap = "The `plot` method can be used on experiments, i.e. spectrum collections (top), or individual spectra (bottom)."}
plot(raw, full = TRUE)
plot(raw[[3]], full = TRUE, reporters = iTRAQ4)
```

## `mgf` read/write support

Read and write support for data in the
[`mgf`](http://www.matrixscience.com/help/data_file_help.html\#GEN)
and `mzTab` formats are available via the `readMgfData`/`writeMgfData`
and `readMzTabData`/`writeMzTabData` functions, respectively. An
example for the latter is shown in the next section.

# Quantitative proteomics

As an running example throughout this document, we will use a TMT
6-plex data set, `PXD000001` to illustrate quantitative data
processing.  The code chunk below first downloads this data file from
the ProteomeXchange server using the `r Biocpkg("rpx")` package.

## The `mzTab` format

The first code chunk downloads the `mzTab` data from the
ProteomeXchange repository [@Vizcaino2014].

```{r downloadmztab, tidy = FALSE}
## Experiment information
library("rpx")
px1 <- PXDataset("PXD000001")
px1
pxfiles(px1)
## Downloading the mzTab data
mztab <- pxget(px1, "PXD000001_mztab.txt")
mztab
```

The code below loads the `mzTab` file into R and generates an `MSnSet`
instance^[Here, we specify `mzTab` format version 0.9. Recent files
have been generated according to the latest specifications, version
1.0, and the `version` does not need to be specified explicitly.],
removes missing values and calculates protein intensities by summing
the peptide quantitation data. The figure below illustrates the
intensities for 5 proteins.


```{r mztab, tidy = FALSE}
## Load mzTab peptide data
qnt <- readMzTabData(mztab, what = "PEP", version = "0.9")
sampleNames(qnt) <- reporterNames(TMT6)
head(exprs(qnt))
## remove missing values
qnt <- filterNA(qnt)
processingData(qnt)

## combine into proteins
## - using the 'accession' feature meta data
## - sum the peptide intensities
protqnt <- combineFeatures(qnt,
                           groupBy = fData(qnt)$accession,
                           fun = sum)
```




```{r matplot, fig.cap = "Protein quantitation data." }
cls <- brewer.pal(5, "Set1")
matplot(t(tail(exprs(protqnt), n = 5)), type = "b",
        lty = 1, col = cls,
        ylab = "Protein intensity (summed peptides)",
        xlab = "TMT reporters")
legend("topright", tail(featureNames(protqnt), n=5),
       lty = 1, bty = "n", cex = .8, col = cls)
```




```{r mztab2}
qntS <- normalise(qnt, "sum")
qntV <- normalise(qntS, "vsn")
qntV2 <- normalise(qnt, "vsn")

acc <- c("P00489", "P00924",
         "P02769", "P62894",
         "ECA")

idx <- sapply(acc, grep, fData(qnt)$accession)
idx2 <- sapply(idx, head, 3)
small <- qntS[unlist(idx2), ]

idx3 <- sapply(idx, head, 10)
medium <- qntV[unlist(idx3), ]

m <- exprs(medium)
colnames(m) <- c("126", "127", "128",
                 "129", "130", "131")
rownames(m) <- fData(medium)$accession

```


```{r heatmap, fig.cap = "A heatmap."}
heatmap(m, col = wbcol, RowSideColors=cls[rownames(m)])
```


```{r spikes, fig.cap = "Spikes plot using `r CRANpkg('ggplot2')`."}
dfr <- data.frame(exprs(small),
                  Protein = as.character(fData(small)$accession),
                  Feature = featureNames(small),
                  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
colnames(dfr) <- c("126", "127", "128", "129", "130", "131",
                   "Protein", "Feature")

dfr$Protein[dfr$Protein == "sp|P00489|PYGM_RABIT"] <- "PHO"
dfr$Protein[grep("ECA", dfr$Protein)] <- "Background"
dfr2 <- melt(dfr)
ggplot(aes(x = variable, y = value, colour = Protein),
       data = dfr2) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group=as.factor(Feature)), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(. ~ Protein) + theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(x = "Reporters", y = "Normalised intensity")
```


## Third-party data

It is possible to import any arbitrary text-based spreadsheet as
*MSnSet* object using either `readMSnSet` or
`readMSnSet2`. The former takes three spreadsheets as input
(for the expression data and the feature and sample meta-data). The
latter uses a single spreadsheet and a vector of expression columns to
populate the assay data and the feature meta-data. Detailed examples
are provided in the `MSnbase-io` vignette, that can be
consulted from R with `vignette("MSnbase-io")` or
[online](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/MSnbase/inst/doc/MSnbase-io.html).


## Working with raw data

We reuse our dedicated `px1` ProteomeXchange data object to
download the raw data (in `mzXML` format) and load it with the
`readMSData` from the `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` package that
produces a raw data experiment object of class `MSnExp` (a new
*on-disk* infrastructure is now available to access the raw
data on disk on demand, rather than loading it all in memory, enabling
the management of more and larger files - see the
`benchmarking` vignette in the `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` package for
details). The raw data is then quantified using the
`quantify` method specifying the TMT 6-plex isobaric tags
and a 7th peak of interest corresponding to the un-dissociated
reporter tag peaks (see the `MSnbase-demo` vignette in
`r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` for details).

```{r mzxmlqnt, cache=TRUE}
mzxml <- pxget(px1, "TMT_Erwinia_1uLSike_Top10HCD_isol2_45stepped_60min_01.mzXML")
rawms <- readMSData(mzxml, centroided = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
qntms <- quantify(rawms, reporters = TMT7, method = "max")
qntms
```

Identification data in the `mzIdentML` format can be added to
`MSnExp` or `MSnSet` instances with the
`addIdentificationData` function. See the function
documentation for examples.

```{r qntdf}
d <- data.frame(Signal = rowSums(exprs(qntms)[, 1:6]),
                Incomplete = exprs(qntms)[, 7])
d <- log(d)
cls <- rep("#00000050", nrow(qnt))
pch <- rep(1, nrow(qnt))
cls[grep("P02769", fData(qnt)$accession)] <- "gold4" ## BSA
cls[grep("P00924", fData(qnt)$accession)] <- "dodgerblue" ## ENO
cls[grep("P62894", fData(qnt)$accession)] <- "springgreen4" ## CYT
cls[grep("P00489", fData(qnt)$accession)] <- "darkorchid2" ## PHO
pch[grep("P02769", fData(qnt)$accession)] <- 19
pch[grep("P00924", fData(qnt)$accession)] <- 19
pch[grep("P62894", fData(qnt)$accession)] <- 19
pch[grep("P00489", fData(qnt)$accession)] <- 19
```

```{r mzp, cache = TRUE, fig.keep='none', warning = FALSE}
mzp <- plotMzDelta(rawms, reporters = TMT6, verbose = FALSE) + ggtitle("")
```


```{r plotmzdelta, fig.cap = "A m/z delta plot."}
mzp
```


```{r incompl, fig.cap = "Incomplete dissociation."}
plot(Signal ~ Incomplete, data = d,
     xlab = expression(Incomplete~dissociation),
     ylab = expression(Sum~of~reporters~intensities),
     pch = 19,
     col = "#4582B380")
grid()
abline(0, 1, lty = "dotted")
abline(lm(Signal ~ Incomplete, data = d), col = "darkblue")
```


```{r maplot, fig.cap = "MAplot on an `MSnSet` instance."}
MAplot(qnt[, c(4, 2)], cex = .9, col = cls, pch = pch, show.statistics = FALSE)
```


## The `r CRANpkg("MALDIquant")` package

This section illustrates some of `r CRANpkg("MALDIquant")`'s data
processing capabilities [@Gibb2012].  The code is taken from the
`processing-peaks.R` script downloaded from
the [package homepage](http://strimmerlab.org/software/maldiquant/).

sA1 <- importBrukerFlex(datapath, verbose=FALSE)
# in the following we use only the first spectrum
s <- sA1[[1]]

```

The following code chunks demonstrate how to use the `r Biocpkg("cleaver")`
package for in-silico cleavage of polypeptides, e.g. cleaving of
*Gastric juice peptide 1 (P01358)* using *Trypsin*:

```{r cleaver, tidy = FALSE}
library(cleaver)
cleave("LAAGKVEDSD", enzym = "trypsin")
```

Sometimes cleavage is not perfect and the enzym miss some cleavage positions:

```{r cleaver_missing, tidy = FALSE}
## miss one cleavage position
cleave("LAAGKVEDSD", enzym = "trypsin", missedCleavages = 1)

## miss zero or one cleavage positions
cleave("LAAGKVEDSD", enzym = "trypsin", missedCleavages = 0:1)
```


Example code to generate an Texshade image to be included directly in
a Latex document or R vignette is presented below.  The R code
generates a Texshade environment and the annotated sequence display
code that is written to a TeX file that can itself be included into a
LaTeX or Sweave document.


```

## The `r Biocpkg("isobar")` package

The `r Biocpkg("isobar")` package [@Breitwieser2011] provides methods
for the statistical analysis of isobarically tagged MS2 experiments.

## The `r Biocpkg("DEP")`  package

The `r Biocpkg("DEP")` package supports analysis of label-free and TMT
pipelines using, as described in its vignette. These can be used with
`MSnSet` objects by converting them to/from `SummarizedExperiment`
objects:

```{r msnsetse}
data(msnset)
se <- as(msnset, "SummarizedExperiment")
se
ms <- as(se, "MSnSet")
ms
```

## The `r Biocpkg("synapter")` package

The `r Biocpkg("synapter")` [@synapter] package comes with a detailed
vignette that describes how to prepare the MSE data and then
process it in R. Several interfaces are available provided the user
with maximum control, easy batch processing capabilities or a
graphical user interface. The conversion into `MSnSet`
instances and filter and combination thereof as well as statistical
analysis are also described.

```{r synapter, eval=FALSE}
## open the synapter vignette
library("synapter")

```

# MS2 spectra identification

At the moment two packages allow the user to run peptide
identifications from within R. Each of the packages interface to an
external peptide database search tool and have more or less the same
workflow, though their syntax differs:

- Prepare the input data.
- Run the search.
- Import the search results and extract the peptides and proteins

## X! Tandem

Following Bioconductor 2.12 the `r Biocpkg("rTANDEM")` package provides the
means to run the popular X!Tandem software [@Craig2004].

Using example code/data from the `r Biocpkg("rTANDEM")` vignette/package, the
following is an example of a typical workflow

### Preparation of the input data {-}

```{r rtandem1, tidy = FALSE}
library(rTANDEM)
taxonomy <- rTTaxo(taxon = "yeast",
                   format = "peptide",
                   URL = system.file(
                     "extdata/fasta/scd.fasta.pro",
                     package="rTANDEM"))
param <- rTParam()
param <- setParamValue(param,
                       'protein', 'taxon',
                       value="yeast")
param <- setParamValue(param, 'list path',
                       'taxonomy information', taxonomy)
param <- setParamValue(param,
                       'list path', 'default parameters',
                       value = system.file(
                         "extdata/default_input.xml",
                         package="rTANDEM"))
param <- setParamValue(param, 'spectrum', 'path',
                       value = system.file(
                         "extdata/test_spectra.mgf",
                         package="rTANDEM"))
param <- setParamValue(param, 'output', 'xsl path',
                       value = system.file(
                         "extdata/tandem-input-style.xsl",
                         package="rTANDEM"))
param <- setParamValue(param, 'output', 'path',
                       value = paste(getwd(),
                         "output.xml", sep="/"))
```


### Performing the search {-}

The analysis is run using the `tandem` function (see also the
`rtandem` function), which returns the results data file path (only
the file name is displayed below).

```{r rtandem2}
resultPath <- tandem(param)
basename(resultPath)
```

### Import and analyse results {-}

```{r rtandem3}
res <- GetResultsFromXML(resultPath)
## the inferred proteins
proteins <- GetProteins(res,
                        log.expect = -1.3,
                        min.peptides = 2)
proteins[, -(4:5), with = FALSE]
## the identified peptides for YFR053C
peptides <- GetPeptides(protein.uid = 1811,
                        results = res,
                        expect = 0.05)
peptides[, c(1:4, 9, 10:16), with = FALSE]
```

More details are provided in the vignette available with
`vignette("rTANDEM")`, for instance the extraction of degenerated
peptides, i.e. peptides found in multiple proteins.



The `r Biocpkg("shinyTANDEM")` package offers a web-based graphical
interface to `r Biocpkg("rTANDEM")`.

## MS-GF+
With the release of Bioconductor 3.0 the `r Biocpkg("MSGFplus")` package has
provided an interface to MS-GF+ [@Kim:2008go, Kim:2010ks]. The package
vignette describe in detail the different ways an MS-GF+ analysis can be
initiated and only a simple example will be given here:

### Preparation of the input data {-}

```{r msgf1}
library("MSGFplus")
## Create a parameter object with a set of parameters
param <- msgfPar(database = system.file('extdata',
                                        'milk-proteins.fasta',
                                        package='MSGFplus'),
                 tolerance = '10 ppm',
                 enzyme = 'Trypsin')

## Add parameters after creation
instrument(param) <- 'QExactive'
tda(param) <- TRUE
ntt(param) <- 2

## Add expected modifications
mods(param)[[1]] <- msgfParModification('Carbamidomethyl',
                                        composition = 'C2H3N1O1',
                                        residues = 'C',
                                        type = 'fix',
                                        position = 'any')

mods(param)[[2]] <- msgfParModification(name = 'Oxidation',
                                        mass = 15.994915,
                                        residues = 'M',
                                        type = 'opt',
                                        position = 'any')

nMod(param) <- 2    # Number of allowed modifications per peptide

## Get a summary of your parameters
show(param)
```

### Performing the search {-}

Initiating the search is done using the `runMSGF` method. As a minimum
it takes a parameter object and a list of raw data files and performs the search
for each data file in sequence. More specialised operations are also possible
such as running it asynchronously, but interested readers should refer to the
`r Biocpkg("MSGFplus")` vignette for additional information.

The first time a search is initialised the MS-GF+ code is downloaded, so be sure
to have an active internet connection (only applies to the first time a search
is run).

```{r msgfplus2, eval=FALSE}
result <- runMSGF(param, 'path/to/a/rawfile.mzML')
```

### Import and analyse results {-}

By default MSGFplus imports the results automatically using `r Biocpkg("mzID")`.
If only one file was analysed, the return value is an mzID object; if
multiple files are analysed at once the return value is an
mzIDCollection object.

If `import=FALSE` the results are not imported and can be accessed at
a later time using the `r Biocpkg("mzID")` package.

### Running MS-GF+ through a GUI {-}

`r Biocpkg("MSGFplus")` comes with a sister package, `r Biocpkg("MSGFgui")`,
which provide a graphic interface to setting up and running MS-GF+
through R. Besides facilitating MS-GF+ analyses, which is arguably
just as easy from the command line, it provides an intuitive way to
investigate and evaluate the resulting identification data.


![A screenshot of MSGFgui](figures/MSGFgui.png)


The figure above shows an example of using `r Biocpkg("MSGFgui")`. It
is possible to gradually drill down in the results starting from the
protein level and ending at the raw spectrum level. mzIdentML files
already created with MS-GF+ (using `r Biocpkg("MSGFplus")` or in other
ways) can easily be imported into the gui to take advantage of the
visualisation features, and results can be exported as either rds (for
R), xlsx (for excel) or txt (for everything else) files.

## Post-search Filtering of MS/MS IDs Using `r Biocpkg("MSnID")`

The main purpose of `r Biocpkg("MSnID")` package is to make sure that
the peptide and protein identifications resulting from MS/MS searches
are sufficiently confident for a given application.} MS/MS peptide and
protein identification is a process that prone to uncertanities.  A
typical and currently most reliable way to quantify uncertainty in the
list of identify spectra, peptides or proteins relies on so-called
decoy database. For bottom-up (i.e. involving protein digestion)
approaches a common way to construct a decoy database is simple
inversion of protein amino-acid sequences. If the spectrum matches to
normal protein sequence it can be true or false match. Matches to
decoy part of the database are false only (excluding the
palindromes). Therefore the false discovery rate (FDR) of
identifications can be estimated as ratio of hits to decoy over normal
parts of the protein sequence database. There are multiple levels of
identification that FDR can be estimated for. First, is at the level
of peptide/protein- to-spectrum matches. Second is at the level of
unique peptide sequences. Note, true peptides tend to be identified by
more then one spectrum. False peptide tend to be sporadic. Therefore,
after collapsing the redundant peptide identifications from multiple
spectra to the level of unique peptide sequence, the FDR typically
increases. The extend of FDR increase depends on the type and
complexity of the sample. The same trend is true for estimating the
identification FDR at the protein level. True proteins tend to be
identified with multiple peptides, while false protein identifications
are commonly covered only by one peptide. Therefore FDR estimate tend
to be even higher for protein level compare to peptide level.  The
estimation of the FDR is also affected by the number of LC-MS (runs)
datasets in the experiment. Again, true identifications tend to be
more consistent from run to run, while false are sporadic. After
collapsing the redundancy across the runs, the number of true
identification reduces much stronger compare to false
identifications. Therefore, the peptide and protein FDR estimates need
to be re-evaluated.  The main objective of the MSnID package is to
provide convenience tools for handling tasks on estimation of FDR,
defining and optimizing the filtering criteria and ensuring confidence
in MS/MS identification data. The user can specify the criteria for
filtering the data (e.g. goodness or p-value of matching of
experimental and theoretical fragmentation mass spectrum, deviation of
theoretical from experimentally measured mass, presence of missed
cleavages in the peptide sequence, etc), evaluate the performance of
the filter judging by FDRs at spectrum, peptide and protein levels,
and finally optimize the filter to achieve the maximum number of
identifications while not exceeding maximally allowed FDR upper
threshold.

### Starting Project and Importing Data {-}

To start a project one have to specify a directory. Currently the only
use of the directory is for storing cached results.

```{r MSnIDstart}
library("MSnID")
msnid <- MSnID(".")
```

Data can imported as `data.frame` or read from mzIdentML file.

```{r MSnIDdataImport1}
PSMresults <- read.delim(system.file("extdata", "human_brain.txt",
                                     package="MSnID"),
                         stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
psms(msnid) <- PSMresults
show(msnid)
```

```{r MSnIDdataImport2, cache=TRUE}
mzids <- system.file("extdata", "c_elegans.mzid.gz", package="MSnID")
msnid <- read_mzIDs(msnid, mzids)
show(msnid)
```

### Analysis of Peptide Sequences {-}

A particular properties of peptide sequences we are interested in are

1. irregular cleavages at the termini of the peptides and
2. missing cleavage site within the peptide sequences.

A particular properties of peptide sequences we are interested in are
(1) irregular cleavages at the termini of the peptides and (2) missing
cleavage site within the peptide sequences:


- Counting the number of irregular cleavage termimi (0, 1 or 2) in
  peptides sequence creates a new column `numIrregCleavages`.
- Counting the number of missed cleavages in peptides sequence
  correspondingly creates a `numMissCleavages` column.

The default regular expressions for the `validCleavagePattern`
and `missedCleavagePattern` correspond to trypsin specificity.


```{r MSnIDsequence}
msnid <- assess_termini(msnid, validCleavagePattern="[KR]\\.[^P]")
msnid <- assess_missed_cleavages(msnid, missedCleavagePattern="[KR](?=[^P$])")
prop.table(table(msnid$numIrregCleavages))
```


Now the object has two more columns, `numIrregCleavages` and
`numMissCleavages`, evidently corresponding to the number of
termini with irregular cleavages and number of missed cleavages within
the peptide sequence. The figure below shows that peptides with 2 or
more missed cleavages are likely to be false identifications.

```{r MSnIDmissedCleavagesPlot}
pepCleav <- unique(psms(msnid)[,c("numMissCleavages", "isDecoy", "peptide")])
pepCleav <- as.data.frame(table(pepCleav[,c("numMissCleavages", "isDecoy")]))
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(pepCleav, aes(x=numMissCleavages, y=Freq, fill=isDecoy)) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity', position='dodge') +
    ggtitle("Number of Missed Cleavages")
```

### Defining the Filter {-}

The criteria that will be used for filtering the MS/MS data has to be present
in the `MSnID` object. We will use -log10 transformed MS-GF+
Spectrum E-value, reflecting the goodness of match experimental and
theoretical fragmentation patterns as one the filtering criteria.
Let's store it under the "msmsScore" name. The score density distribution
shows that it is a good discriminant between non-decoy (red)
and decoy hits (green).


For alternative MS/MS search engines refer to the engine-specific manual for
the names of parameters reflecting the quality of MS/MS spectra matching.
Examples of such parameters are `E-Value` for X!Tandem
and `XCorr` and `$\Delta$Cn2` for SEQUEST.


As a second criterion we will be using the absolute mass measurement
error (in ppm units) of the parent ion. The mass measurement errors tend to
be small for non-decoy (enriched with real identificaiton) hits (red line) and
is effectively uniformly distributed for decoy hits.

```{r MSnIDfilteringCriteria}
msnid$msmsScore <- -log10(msnid$`MS-GF:SpecEValue`)
msnid$absParentMassErrorPPM <- abs(mass_measurement_error(msnid))
```

MS/MS fiters are handled by a special *MSnIDFilter* class
objects.  Individual filtering criteria can be set by name (that is
present in `names(msnid)`), comparison operator (>, <, = , ...)
defining if we should retain hits with higher or lower given the
threshold and finally the threshold value itself. The filter below set
in such a way that retains only those matches that has less then 5 ppm
of parent ion mass measurement error and more the
$10^7$ MS-GF:SpecEValue.

```{r MSnIDsettingFilter}
filtObj <- MSnIDFilter(msnid)
filtObj$absParentMassErrorPPM <- list(comparison="<", threshold=5.0)
filtObj$msmsScore <- list(comparison=">", threshold=8.0)
show(filtObj)
```

The stringency of the filter can be evaluated at different levels.

```{r MSnIDfilterAssessment}
evaluate_filter(msnid, filtObj, level="PSM")
evaluate_filter(msnid, filtObj, level="peptide")
evaluate_filter(msnid, filtObj, level="accession")
```

### Optimizing the Filter {-}

The threshold values in the example above are not necessarily optimal and set
just be in the range of probable values. Filters can be optimized to ensure
maximum number of identifications (peptide-to-spectrum matches,
unique peptide sequences or proteins) within a given FDR upper limit.

First, the filter can be optimized simply by stepping through
individual parameters and their combinations. The idea has been described in
[@Piehowski2013a]. The resulting `MSnIDFilter` object can be
used for final data filtering or can be used as a good starting parameters for
follow-up refining optimizations with more advanced algorithms.

```{r MSnIDfilterOptimization1}
filtObj.grid <- optimize_filter(filtObj, msnid, fdr.max=0.01,
                                method="Grid", level="peptide",
                                n.iter=500)
show(filtObj.grid)
```

The resulting `filtObj.grid` can be further fine tuned with such
optimization routines as simulated annealing or Nelder-Mead optimization.

```{r MSnIDfilterOptimization2}
filtObj.nm <- optimize_filter(filtObj.grid, msnid, fdr.max=0.01,
                                method="Nelder-Mead", level="peptide",
                                n.iter=500)
show(filtObj.nm)
```

Evaluate non-optimized and optimized filters.

```{r MSnIDfilterAssessment2}
evaluate_filter(msnid, filtObj, level="peptide")
evaluate_filter(msnid, filtObj.grid, level="peptide")
evaluate_filter(msnid, filtObj.nm, level="peptide")
```

Finally applying filter to remove predominantly false identifications.

```{r MSnIDapplyFilter}
msnid <- apply_filter(msnid, filtObj.nm)
show(msnid)
```

Removing hits to decoy and contaminant sequences using the same
`apply_filter` method.

```{r MSnIDremovingDecoyAndContaminants}
msnid <- apply_filter(msnid, "isDecoy == FALSE")
show(msnid)
msnid <- apply_filter(msnid, "!grepl('Contaminant',accession)")
show(msnid)
```

### Interface with Other Bioconductor Packages {-}

One can extract the entire PSMs tables as `data.frame` or `data.table`

```{r MSnIDgetDataOut1}
psm.df <- psms(msnid)
psm.dt <- as(msnid, "data.table")
```

If only interested in the non-redundant list of confidently identified
peptides or proteins

```{r MSnIDgetDataOut2}
peps <- peptides(msnid)
head(peps)
prots <- accessions(msnid)
head(prots)
prots <- proteins(msnid) # may be more intuitive then accessions
head(prots)
```

The `r Biocpkg("MSnID")` package is aimed at providing convenience
functionality to handle MS/MS identifications. Quantification
*per se* is outside of the scope of the package. The only type
of quantitation that can be seamlessly tied with MS/MS identification
analysis is so-called *spectral counting* approach. In such an
approach a peptide abundance is considered to be directly proportional
to the number of matched MS/MS spectra.  In its turn protein abunance
is proportional to the sum of the number of spectra of the matching
peptides. The *MSnID* object can be converted to an
*MSnSet* object defined in `r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` that extends
generic Bioconductor *eSet* class to quantitative proteomics
data.  The spectral count data can be analyzed with `r Biocpkg("msmsEDA")`,
`r Biocpkg("msmsTests")` or `r Biocpkg("DESeq")` packages.

```{r MSnIDconvertingToMSnSet}
msnset <- as(msnid, "MSnSet")
library("MSnbase")
head(fData(msnset))
head(exprs(msnset))
```

Note, the convertion from `MSnID` to `MSnSet` uses
peptides as features. The number of redundant peptide observations
represent so-called spectral count that can be used for rough
quantitative analysis. Summing of all of the peptide counts to a
proteins level can be done with `combineFeatures` function from
`r Biocpkg("MSnbase")` package.

```{r MSnIDsummingPeptidesToProteins}
msnset <- combineFeatures(msnset,
                            fData(msnset)$accession,
                            redundancy.handler="unique",
                            fun="sum",
                            cv=FALSE)
head(fData(msnset))
head(exprs(msnset))
```


```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
unlink(".Rcache", recursive=TRUE)
```

# Quality control {#sec:qc}

Quality control (QC) is an essential part of any high throughput data
driven approach. Bioconductor has a rich history of QC for various
genomics data and currently two packages support proteomics QC.

`r Biocpkg("proteoQC")` provides a dedicated a dedicated pipeline that will
produce a dynamic and extensive html report. It uses the
`r Biocpkg("rTANDEM")` package to automate the generation of identification
data and uses information about the experimental/replication design.


The `r Biocpkg("qcmetrics")` package is a general framework to define QC
metrics and bundle them together to generate html or pdf reports. It
provides some ready made metrics for MS data and N15 labelled
data.

# Annotation {#sec:annot}

In this section, we briefly present some Bioconductor annotation
infrastructure.

We start with the `r Biocpkg("hpar")` package, an interface to the
*Human Protein Atlas* [@Uhlen2005, Uhlen2010], to retrieve
subcellular localisation information for the `ENSG00000002746`
ensemble gene.

```{r annot1, cache=FALSE}
id <- "ENSG00000105323"
library("hpar")
getHpa(id, "hpaSubcellularLoc")
```

Below, we make use of the human annotation package
`r Biocannopkg("org.Hs.eg.db")` and the Gene Ontology annotation package
`r Biocannopkg("GO.db")` to retrieve compatible information with above.


```{r annot2, cache=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("org.Hs.eg.db")
library("GO.db")
ans <- AnnotationDbi::select(org.Hs.eg.db,
                             keys = id,
                             columns = c("ENSEMBL", "GO", "ONTOLOGY"),
                             keytype = "ENSEMBL")
ans <- ans[ans$ONTOLOGY == "CC", ]
ans
sapply(as.list(GOTERM[ans$GO]), slot, "Term")
```

Finally, this information can also be retrieved from on-line databases
using the `r Biocpkg("biomaRt")` package [@Durinck2005].

```{r annot3, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library("biomaRt")
ensembl <- useMart("ensembl",dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl")
efilter <- "ensembl_gene_id"
eattr <- c("go_id", "name_1006", "namespace_1003")
bmres <- getBM(attributes=eattr, filters = efilter, values = id, mart = ensembl)
bmres[bmres$namespace_1003 == "cellular_component", "name_1006"]
```

# Other packages {#sec:packages}

## Bioconductor packages

```{r protpacks, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# biocVersion has to be of type character
biocv <- as.character(biocVersion())
pkTab <- list(Proteomics = proteomicsPackages(biocv),
              MassSpectrometry = massSpectrometryPackages(biocv),
              MassSpectrometryData = massSpectrometryDataPackages(biocv))
```

This section provides a complete list of packages available in the
relevant Bioconductor version `r biocv`
[*biocView*](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html>) categories.
the tables below represent the packages for the `Proteomics`
(`r nrow(pkTab[["Proteomics"]])` packages), `MassSpectrometry`
(`r nrow(pkTab[["MassSpectrometry"]])` packages) and
`MassSpectrometryData` (`r nrow(pkTab[["MassSpectrometryData"]])`
experiment packages) categories.


```{r protstab, echo=FALSE}
DT::datatable(pkTab[["Proteomics"]])
```

```{r mstab, echo=FALSE}
DT::datatable(pkTab[["MassSpectrometry"]])
```

```{r msdatatab, echo=FALSE}
DT::datatable(pkTab[["MassSpectrometryData"]])
```

The tables can easily be generated with the `proteomicsPackages`,
`massSpectrometryPackages` and `massSpectrometryDataPackages`
functions. The respective package tables can then be interactively
explored using the `display` function.


```{r pkgs, eval=FALSE}
pp <- proteomicsPackages()
display(pp)
```

## Other CRAN packages

```{r cntCRAN, echo=FALSE}
X <- readLines("http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ChemPhys.html")
x2 <- grep("Related links:", X)
x1 <- grep("CRAN packages:", X)
np <- length(grep("../packages/", X[x1:x2]))
```

The CRAN task view
on
[Chemometrics and Computational Physics](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ChemPhys.html) is
another useful ressource listing `r np` packages, including a set of
packages for mass spectrometry and proteomics, some of which are
illustrated in this document.
